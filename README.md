# bottlenecks-of-image-classifier
Bottlenecks are the just prefinal layer of entire Neural network

This are the bottlenecks of my first Image Classifier which i created with the help of Tensorflow for Poets and after i am going to optimize the model.
Bottlenecks are the one step before the final step of the Fianl Decision of our Classifier.
